## Information

For the UNSW course 'Advanced Algorithm Design and
Analysis' (COMP3821) my group created a Bananagrams Engine.
The Engine is capable of rapidly winning the game in a
multiplayer and single player environment. An analytical report
on how we implemented this can be found&nbsp;
<a href="https://github.com/flynnlambrechts/bananagrams_engine_comp3821/blob/report/report.pdf"> here</a>.

Due to the computation cost of running the engine for
potentially multiple users this is just a demo site for our
Bananagrams engine. The above illustrates a few examples of how
the engine played in real games with a delay added between
steps. In reality the engine could complete the game in less
than 0.1s consistently.
